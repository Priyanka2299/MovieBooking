//booking M : 1 User
//Booking 1: M ShowSeat but in cancelled cases you have M:M (in one booking showseats which are confirmed and which are cancelled)
// Booking 1: M Payment -> One Payment will be associated with 1 booking only
//The @Enumerated annotation in Spring Boot (actually from JPA, part of Jakarta Persistence)
// used to tell JPA how to save enum values in a database column â€” either as a name or an ordinal number.
//EnumType.STRING	Stores the enum name as a String in DB (e.g., "ACTIVE")
//EnumType.ORDINAL	Stores the enum ordinal (index) in DB (e.g., 0, 1, 2): Bealdung
